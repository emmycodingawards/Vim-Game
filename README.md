# About C++ Logic
C++ Logic will test the user's knowledge on common mistakes beginning programmers make in C++ using a quiz format. Some questions will be multiple choice and others will be give the user sample code to debug. At the end of the quiz, the user's score will be calculated and a list of the conceptst they did not perform well in will be provided. These will both be sent to their "professor" using networking.
