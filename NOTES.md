# Format:
- Intro to C++ Logic
- Question prints to screen
- 1) Example prints to screen that user needs to debug (using strok() to check)
- -OR-
- 2) Multiple choice answer prints to screen (if statements)
- User inputs answer 
- Correct answer prints out on screen
- Linked List/Bitfield are updated based on correctness
- User is taken to next question if correct or taken back if there have been too many incorrect answers inputted
