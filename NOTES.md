#  main.java
- Just calling functions

# questions.java
- Programmers: Emmy and Preet
- See Questions Project board to keep track of questions that have been completed

# linkedlist.java
- Programmer: Chris M.

# bitfield.java
- Programmer: Chris V.

# Makefile


# Possible Features:
- Timed questions
- Incorporate music (if using java)

# Format:
- Intro to C++ Logic
- Question prints to screen
- 1) Example prints to screen that user needs to debug (using strok() to check)
- -OR-
- 2) Multiple choice answer prints to screen (if statements)
- User inputs answer 
- Correct answer prints out on screen
- Linked List/Bitfield are updated based on correctness
- User is taken to next question if correct or taken back if there have been too many incorrect answers inputted
